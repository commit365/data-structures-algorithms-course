# Lesson 24: Backtracking Algorithms

Backtracking is a powerful algorithmic technique used for solving problems incrementally by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they are not valid. This approach is particularly useful for solving constraint satisfaction problems where you need to explore all potential solutions.

## 24.1 Introduction to Backtracking

### 24.1.1 Definition
**Backtracking** is a method for solving problems by building candidates for solutions incrementally and abandoning candidates ("backtracking") as soon as it is determined that they cannot lead to a valid solution. It can be thought of as a depth-first search through the solution space.

### 24.1.2 Key Concepts
- **State Space Tree**: A tree structure that represents all possible states (or configurations) of the problem. Each node represents a state, and edges represent the transition from one state to another.
- **Pruning**: The process of eliminating branches in the state space tree that do not lead to a valid solution, thus reducing the search space.
- **Recursive Exploration**: Backtracking often involves recursive functions that explore each possible choice and backtrack when a choice leads to an invalid state.

## 24.2 Applications of Backtracking

Backtracking is widely used in various problem-solving scenarios, especially in combinatorial problems, puzzles, and optimization problems.

### 24.2.1 Classic Backtracking Problems

#### 24.2.1.1 N-Queens Problem
The **N-Queens problem** involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

##### Implementation
```python
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    # Check this column on upper side
    for i in range(row):
        if board[i][col] == 1:
            return False

    # Check upper diagonal on left side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False

    # Check upper diagonal on right side
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):
        if board[i][j] == 1:
            return False

    return True

def solve_n_queens_util(board, row):
    if row >= len(board):
        return True  # All queens are placed successfully

    for col in range(len(board)):
        if is_safe(board, row, col):
            board[row][col] = 1  # Place queen
            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1):  # Recur to place rest of the queens
                return True
            board[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack

    return False

def solve_n_queens(n):
    board = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize the board
    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0):
        return "No solution exists"
    return board
```

#### Example Usage
```python
n = 4
solution = solve_n_queens(n)
for row in solution:
    print(row)  # Output: A valid configuration of queens on the board
```

#### 24.2.1.2 Sudoku Solver
The **Sudoku solver** is another classic backtracking problem where the goal is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

##### Implementation
```python
def is_valid(board, row, col, num):
    # Check if the number is not in the current row
    for x in range(9):
        if board[row][x] == num:
            return False

    # Check if the number is not in the current column
    for x in range(9):
        if board[x][col] == num:
            return False

    # Check if the number is not in the current 3x3 grid
    start_row, start_col = 3 * (row // 3), 3 * (col // 3)
    for i in range(3):
        for j in range(3):
            if board[i + start_row][j + start_col] == num:
                return False

    return True

def solve_sudoku(board):
    empty = find_empty_location(board)
    if not empty:
        return True  # Puzzle solved

    row, col = empty
    for num in range(1, 10):
        if is_valid(board, row, col, num):
            board[row][col] = num  # Assign number

            if solve_sudoku(board):  # Recur
                return True

            board[row][col] = 0  # Backtrack

    return False

def find_empty_location(board):
    for i in range(9):
        for j in range(9):
            if board[i][j] == 0:
                return (i, j)  # Return row, col of an empty cell
    return None
```

#### Example Usage
```python
sudoku_board = [
    [5, 3, 0, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [6, 0, 0, 1, 9, 5, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 9, 8, 0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0],
    [8, 0, 0, 0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 3],
    [4, 0, 0, 8, 0, 3, 0, 0, 1],
    [7, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 6],
    [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 8, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 4, 1, 9, 0, 0, 5],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 7, 9]
]

if solve_sudoku(sudoku_board):
    for row in sudoku_board:
        print(row)  # Output: The solved Sudoku board
else:
    print("No solution exists")
```

#### 24.2.1.3 Permutations
Generating all permutations of a given list of elements can be efficiently solved using backtracking.

##### Implementation
```python
def generate_permutations(arr, start=0):
    if start == len(arr) - 1:
        print(arr)  # Print the current permutation
    for i in range(start, len(arr)):
        arr[start], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[start]  # Swap
        generate_permutations(arr, start + 1)  # Recur
        arr[start], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[start]  # Backtrack
```

#### Example Usage
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3]
print("Permutations:")
generate_permutations(arr)  # Output: All permutations of [1, 2, 3]
```

#### 24.2.1.4 Combinations
Generating combinations of a set can also be efficiently done using backtracking.

##### Implementation
```python
def generate_combinations(arr, n, start=0, current=[]):
    if len(current) == n:
        print(current)  # Print the current combination
        return
    for i in range(start, len(arr)):
        current.append(arr[i])  # Include the element
        generate_combinations(arr, n, i + 1, current)  # Recur
        current.pop()  # Backtrack
```

#### Example Usage
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
n = 2
print("Combinations:")
generate_combinations(arr, n)  # Output: All combinations of size 2 from [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

#### 24.2.1.5 Graph Coloring
The **graph coloring problem** involves assigning colors to the vertices of a graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. This is often solved using backtracking.

##### Implementation
```python
def is_safe(graph, colors, vertex, c):
    for neighbor in graph[vertex]:
        if colors[neighbor] == c:  # Check if the color is already assigned
            return False
    return True

def graph_coloring_util(graph, m, colors, vertex):
    if vertex == len(graph):  # All vertices are assigned a color
        return True

    for c in range(1, m + 1):  # Try different colors
        if is_safe(graph, colors, vertex, c):
            colors[vertex] = c  # Assign color
            if graph_coloring_util(graph, m, colors, vertex + 1):  # Recur
                return True
            colors[vertex] = 0  # Backtrack

    return False

def graph_coloring(graph, m):
    colors = [0] * len(graph)  # Initialize color assignment
    if not graph_coloring_util(graph, m, colors, 0):
        return "No solution exists"
    return colors
```

#### Example Usage
```python
graph = {
    0: [1, 2],
    1: [0, 2],
    2: [0, 1, 3],
    3: [2]
}
m = 3  # Number of colors
result = graph_coloring(graph, m)
print("Color assignment:", result)  # Output: Color assignment for the graph
```
